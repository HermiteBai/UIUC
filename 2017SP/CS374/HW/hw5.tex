\item Given an array of $n$ unsorted integers $A$ and $k$ ranks
  $i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k$ describe an algorithm that outputs
  the elements in $A$ with these given $k$ ranks. Your algorithm
  should run in $O(n \log k)$ time. One can easily do this via
  sorting in $O(n \log n)$ time. There is also an $O(nk)$ time algorithm
  (how?).

\item  Let $w \in \Sigma^*$ be a string. We say that
  $u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_h$ where each $u_i \in \Sigma^*$ is a valid split
  of $w$ iff $w = u_1u_2\ldots u_h$ (the concatenation of
  $u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_h$). Given a valid split $u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_h$ of
  $w$ we define its $\ell_3$ measure as $\sum_{i=1}^h |u_i|^3$. 

  Given a language $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ a string $w \in L^*$ iff
  there is a valid split $u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_h$ of $w$ such that each
  $u_i \in L$; we call such a split an $L$-valid split of $w$.  Assume
  you have access to a subroutine $\IsSinL(x)$ which outputs whether
  the input string $x$ is in $L$ or not. To evaluate the running time
  of your solution you can assume that each call to $\IsSinL()$ takes
  constant time.

  Describe an efficient algorithm that given a string $w$ and access to
  a language $L$ via $\IsSinL(x)$ outputs an $L$-valid split of $w$ 
  with minimum $\ell_3$ measure if one exists.

\item Recall that a \emph{palindrome} is any string that is exactly the same as its reversal, like \Sym{I}, or \Sym{DEED}, or \Sym{RACECAR}, or \Sym{AMANAPLANACATACANALPANAMA}.

Any string can be decomposed into a sequence of palindrome substrings.  For example, the string \Sym{BUBBASEESABANANA} (“Bubba sees a banana.”\@) can be broken into palindromes in the following ways (among many others):
\begin{gather*}
	\Sym{BUB} \Cdot \Sym{BASEESAB} \Cdot \Sym{ANANA}\\
	\Sym{B} \Cdot \Sym{U} \Cdot \Sym{BB} \Cdot \Sym{A} \Cdot \Sym{SEES} \Cdot \Sym{ABA} \Cdot \Sym{NAN} \Cdot \Sym{A}\\
	\Sym{B} \Cdot \Sym{U} \Cdot \Sym{BB} \Cdot \Sym{A} \Cdot \Sym{SEES} \Cdot \Sym{A} \Cdot \Sym{B} \Cdot \Sym{ANANA}\\
	\Sym{B} \Cdot \Sym{U} \Cdot \Sym{B} \Cdot \Sym{B} \Cdot \Sym{A} \Cdot \Sym{S} \Cdot \Sym{E} \Cdot \Sym{E} \Cdot \Sym{S} \Cdot \Sym{A} \Cdot \Sym{B} \Cdot \Sym{ANA}  \Cdot \Sym{N} \Cdot \Sym{A}
\end{gather*}

Describe and analyze an efficient algorithm that given
a string $w$ and an integer $k$ decides whether $w$ can be
split into palindromes each of which is of length at least $k$. For example,
given the input string \Sym{BUBBASEESABANANA} and $3$
your algorithm would answer yes because one can find a split 
$\Sym{BUB} \Cdot \Sym{BASEESAB} \Cdot \Sym{ANANA}$. The answer should be
no if we set $k=4$. Note that the answer is always yes for $k=1$.

\item    The McKing chain wants to open several restaurants along Red street
  in Shampoo-Banana. The possible locations are at $L_1,L_2, \ldots,
  L_n$ where $L_i$ is at distance $m_i$ meters from the start of Red
  street. Assume that the street is a straight line and the locations
  are in increasing order of distance from the starting point (thus $0
  \leq m_1 < m_2 < \ldots < m_n$). McKing has collected some data
  indicating that opening a restaurant at location $L_i$ will yield a
  profit of $p_i$ independent of where the other restaurants are
  located. However, the city of Shampoo-Banana has a zoning law which
  requires that any two McKing locations should be $D$ or more meters
  apart. Describe an algorithm that McKing can use to figure out the
  maximum profit it can obtain by opening restaurants while
  satisfying the city's zoning law.

\subsection*{Solved Problem}

\begin{enumerate}\parindent 1.5em
\item[4.]
A \emph{shuffle} of two strings $X$ and $Y$ is formed by interspersing the characters into a new string, keeping the characters of $X$ and $Y$ in the same order. For example, the string \Sym{BANANAANANAS} is a shuffle of the strings \SymBlue{BANANA} and \Sym{ANANAS} in several different ways.
\begin{center}
	\Sym{\u{BANANA}ANANAS}
	\qquad
	\Sym{\u{BAN}ANA\u{ANA}NAS}
	\qquad
	\Sym{\u{B}AN\u{AN}A\u{A}NA\u{NA}S}
\end{center}
Similarly, the strings \Sym{PRODGYRNAMAMMIINCG} and \Sym{DYPRONGARMAMMICING} are both shuffles of \SymBlue{DYNAMIC} and \Sym{PROGRAMMING}:
\begin{center}
	\Sym{PRO\u{D}G\u{Y}R\u{NAM}AMMI\u{I}N\u{C}G}
	\qquad
	\qquad
	\Sym{\u{DY}PRO\u{N}G\u{A}R\u{M}AMM\u{IC}ING}
\end{center}
Given three strings $A[1\,..\,m]$, $B[1\,..\,n]$, and $C[1\,..\,m+n]$, describe and analyze an algorithm to determine whether $C$ is a shuffle of $A$ and $B$.

\begin{solution}
We define a boolean function $\emph{Shuf}(i,j)$, which is $\textsc{True}$ if and only if the prefix $C[1\,..\,i+j]$ is a shuffle of the prefixes $A[1\,..\,i]$ and $B[1\,..\,j]$.  This function satisfies the following recurrence:
\[
	\emph{Shuf}(i,j) = 
	\begin{cases}
		\textsc{True} & \text{if $i=j=0$}
\\[0.5ex]
		\emph{Shuf}(0,j-1) \strut\land (B[j]=C[j]) & \text{if $i=0$ and $j>0$}
\\[0.5ex]
		\emph{Shuf}(i-1,0) \strut\land (A[i]=C[i]) & \text{if $i>0$ and $j=0$}
\\[0.5ex]
		\left(\emph{Shuf}(i-1,j) \strut\land (A[i]=C[i+j])\right)
\\
			\qquad {}\lor \left(\emph{Shuf}(i,j-1) \strut\land (B[j]=C[i+j])\right)
			& \text{if $i>0$ and $j>0$}
	\end{cases}
\]

We need to compute $\emph{Shuf}(m,n)$.

We can memoize all function values into a two-dimensional array $\emph{Shuf}[0\,..\,m][0\,..\,n]$.  Each array entry $\emph{Shuf}[i,j]$ depends only on the entries immediately below and immediately to the right: $\emph{Shuf}[i-1,j]$ and $\emph{Shuf}[i,j-1]$.  Thus, we can fill the array in standard row-major order.  The original recurrence gives us the following pseudocode:
\begin{algo}
	\textul{$\textsc{Shuffle?}(A[1\,..\,m],~ B[1\,..\,n],~ C[1\,..\,m+n])$:}\+
\\	$\emph{Shuf}[0,0] \gets \textsc{True}$
\\	for $j\gets 1$ to $n$\+
\\		$\emph{Shuf}[0,j] \gets \emph{Shuf}[0,j-1] \strut\land (B[j]=C[j])$\-
\\[0.5ex]
	for $i\gets 1$ to $n$\+
\\		$\emph{Shuf}[i,0] \gets \emph{Shuf}[i-1,0] \strut\land (A[i]=B[i])$
\\[0.5ex]
		for $j\gets 1$ to $n$\+
\\			$\emph{Shuf}[i,j] \gets \textsc{False}$
\\			if $A[i]=C[i+j]$\+
\\				$\emph{Shuf}[i,j] \gets
					\emph{Shuf}[i,j] \lor \emph{Shuf}[i-1,j]$\-
\\			if $B[i]=C[i+j]$\+
\\				$\emph{Shuf}[i,j] \gets
					\emph{Shuf}[i,j] \lor \emph{Shuf}[i,j-1]$\-\-\-
\\[1ex]
	return $\emph{Shuf}[m,n]$
\end{algo}
The algorithm runs in \EMPH{$O(mn)$ time}.
\end{solution}

\begin{rubric}
Max 10 points: Standard dynamic programming rubric.  No proofs required.  Max 7 points for a slower polynomial-time algorithm; scale partial credit accordingly.
\end{rubric}

\end{enumerate}


\begin{Rubric}{Standard dynamic programming rubric} For problems worth 10 poins:

\begin{itemize}
\item 6 points for a correct recurrence, described either using mathematical notation or as pseudocode for a recursive algorithm.
\begin{itemize}\cramped
\item[$+$]
1 point for a clear \textbf{English} description of the function you are trying to evaluate.  (Otherwise, we don’t even know what you’re \emph{trying} to do.)  \textbf{Automatic zero if the English description is missing.}
\item[$+$]
1 point for stating how to call your function to get the final answer.
\item[$+$]
1 point for base case(s).  $-$\textonehalf\ for one \emph{minor} bug, like a typo  or an off-by-one error.
\item[$+$]
3 points for recursive case(s).  $-$1 for each \emph{minor} bug, like a typo or an off-by-one error.  
\textbf{No credit for the rest of the problem if the recursive case(s) are incorrect.}
\end{itemize}
\item
4 points for details of the dynamic programming algorithm
\begin{itemize}\cramped
\item[$+$]
1 point for describing the memoization data structure
\item[$+$]
2 points for describing a correct evaluation order; a clear picture is usually sufficient.  If you use nested loops, be sure to specify the nesting order.
\item[$+$]
1 point for time analysis
\end{itemize}
\item
It is \emph{not} necessary to state a space bound.

\item
For problems that ask for an algorithm that computes an optimal \emph{structure}---such as a subset, partition, subsequence, or tree---an algorithm that computes only the \emph{value} or \emph{cost} of the optimal structure is sufficient for full credit, unless the problem says otherwise.

\item
Official solutions usually include pseudocode for the final iterative dynamic programming algorithm, \EMPH{but iterative psuedocode is not required for full credit}.  If your solution includes iterative pseudocode, you do not need to separately describe the recurrence, memoization structure, or  evaluation order.  (But you still need to describe the underlying recursive function in English.)

\item
Official solutions will provide target time bounds.  Algorithms that are faster than this target are worth more points; slower algorithms are worth fewer points, typically by 2 or 3 points (out of 10) for each factor of $n$.  Partial credit is scaled to the new maximum score, and all points above 10 are recorded as extra credit.

\qquad We rarely include these target time bounds in the actual questions, because when we have included them, significantly more students turned in algorithms that meet the target time bound but didn’t work (earning 0/10) instead of correct algorithms that are slower than the target time bound (earning 8/10).
\end{itemize}
