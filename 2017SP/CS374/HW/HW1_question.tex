\item
For each of the following languages over the alphabet $\set{\Sym0,\Sym1}$, give a regular expression that describes that language, and briefly argue why your expression is correct.

\begin{enumerate}
\item All strings except \Sym{101}.
\item All strings that end in \Sym{01} and contain \Sym{000}
as a substring.
\item All strings in which every nonempty maximal substring of \Sym{0}s
  is of odd length. For instance \Sym{1001} is not in the language while
  \Sym{0100010} is.
\item All strings that do not contain the substring \Sym{101}.
\item All strings that do not contain the subsequence \Sym{101}.
\end{enumerate}




%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\item 
Let $L$ be the set of all strings in $\set{\Sym0,\Sym1}^*$ that contain at most
two occurrences of the substring \Sym{100}.

\begin{enumerate}\parindent 1.5em
\item  Describe a DFA that over the alphabet $\Sigma = \set{\Sym0,\Sym1}$ that accepts the language $L$.  Argue that your machine accepts every string in $L$ and nothing else, by explaining what each state in your DFA \emph{means}.

You may either draw the DFA or describe it formally, but the states $Q$, the start state $s$, the accepting states $A$, and the transition function $\delta$ must be clearly specified.

\item Give a regular expression for $L$, and briefly argue why the expression is correct.
\end{enumerate}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------

\item Let $L_1, L_2,$ and $L_3$ be regular languages over $\Sigma$
  accepted by DFAs $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, \delta_1, s_1, A_1)$,
  $M_2 = (Q_2, \Sigma, \delta_2, s_1, A_2)$, and $M_3 = (Q_3,
  \Sigma, \delta_3, s_3, A_3)$, respectively.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe a DFA $M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, A)$ in terms of $M_1,
  M_2,$ and $M_3$ that accepts $L = \{w \mid w$ is in exactly two of
  $\{L_1, L_2, L_3\}\}.$ Formally specify the components $Q, \delta,
  s,$ and $A$ for $M$ in terms of the components of $M_1, M_2,$ and
  $M_3$.
\item Prove by induction that your construction is correct.

\subsection*{Solved problem}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[4.]
\EMPH{C comments} are the set of strings over alphabet $\Sigma = \Set{\Sym{*}, \Sym{/}, \Sym{A}, \Sym{\Blank}, \Sym{\Enter} }$ that form a proper comment in the C program language and its descendants, like C++ and Java.  Here~$\Sym{\Enter}$ represents the newline character, $\Sym{\Blank}$ represents any other whitespace character (like the space and tab characters), and \Sym{A} represents any non-whitespace character other than~$\Sym{*}$~or~$\Sym{/}$.\footnotemark\
There are two types of C comments:
\begin{itemize}
\item Line comments:  Strings of the form $\Sym{//} \cdots \Sym{\Enter}$\,.
\item Block comments:  Strings of the form $\Sym{/*} \cdots \Sym{*/}$.
\end{itemize}
%
Following the C99 standard, we explicitly disallow \EMPH{nesting}
comments of the same type.  A~line comment starts with $\Sym{//}$ and
ends at the first $\Sym{\Enter}$ after the opening $\Sym{//}$.  A
block comment starts with $\Sym{/*}$ and ends at the the first
$\Sym{*/}$ completely after the opening $\Sym{/*}$; in particular,
every block comment has at least two $\Sym*$s.  For example, each of
the following strings is a valid C comment:
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt
\item $\Sym{/***/}$
\item $\Sym{//\Sym{\Blank}//\Sym{\Blank}\Enter}$
\item $\Sym{/*///\Sym{\Blank}*\Sym{\Blank}\Enter**/}$ 
\item $\Sym{/*\Sym{\Blank}//\Sym{\Blank}\Enter\Sym{\Blank}*/}$ 
\end{itemize}
On the other hand, \emph{none} of the following strings is a valid C comments: 
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt
\item \Sym{/*/}
\item $\Sym{//\Sym{\Blank}//\Sym{\Blank}\Enter\Sym{\Blank}\Enter}$
\item $\Sym{/*\Sym{\Blank}/*\Sym{\Blank}*/\Sym{\Blank}*/}$ 
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Describe a DFA that accepts the set of all C comments.
\item
Describe a DFA that accepts the set of all strings composed entirely of blanks (\Sym{\Blank}), newlines (\Sym{\Enter}), and C comments.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{You must explain \emph{in English} how your DFAs work.} Drawings or formal descriptions without English explanations will receive no credit, even if they are correct.

% ======
\footnotetext{The actual C commenting syntax is considerably more complex than described here, because of character and string literals.
%
\begin{itemize}\cramped
\item
The opening \Sym{/*} or \Sym{//} of a comment must not be inside a string literal ($\Sym{“}\cdots\Sym{“}$) or a (multi-)character literal ($\Sym{'}\cdots\Sym{'}$).
\item
The opening double-quote of a string literal must not be inside a character literal (\Sym{'"'}) or a comment.
\item
The closing double-quote of a string literal must not be escaped (\Sym{\textbackslash"})
\item
The opening single-quote of a character literal must not be inside a string literal ($\Sym{"}\cdots\Sym{'}\cdots\Sym{"}$) or a comment.
\item
The closing single-quote of a character literal must not be escaped (\Sym{\textbackslash'})
\item
A backslash escapes the next symbol if and only if it is not itself escaped (\Sym{\textbackslash\textbackslash}) or inside a comment.
\end{itemize}
%
For example, the string $\Sym{"/*\textbackslash\textbackslash\textbackslash"*/"/*"/*\textbackslash"/*"*/}$ is a valid string literal (representing the 5-character string \Sym{/*\textbackslash"\textbackslash*/}, which is itself a valid block comment!\@) followed immediately by a valid block comment.  \EMPH{For this homework question, just pretend that the characters \Sym{'}, \Sym{"}, and \Sym{\textbackslash} don't exist.}

Commenting in C+\!+ is even more complicated, thanks to the addition of \emph{raw} string literals.  Don't ask.

Some C and C+\!+ compilers do support nested block comments, in violation of the language specification.  A few other languages, like OCaml, explicitly allow nesting block comments.}
% ======

\newpage
\begin{solution}~
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item
The following eight-state DFA recognizes the language of C comments.  All missing transitions lead to a hidden reject state.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Fig/one-C-comment}
\end{center}
The states are labeled mnemonically as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $s$ — We have not read anything.
\item / — We just read the initial \Sym/.
\item // — We are reading a line comment.
\item $L$ — We have read a complete line comment.
\item /* — We are reading a block comment, and we did not just read a \Sym* after the opening \Sym{/*}. 
\item /** — We are reading a block comment, and we just read a \Sym* after the opening \Sym{/*}. 
\item $B$ — We have read a complete block comment. 
\end{itemize}

\bigskip\bigskip
\item
By merging the accepting states of the previous DFA with the start state and adding white-space transitions at the start state, we obtain the following six-state DFA.  Again, all missing transitions lead to a hidden reject state.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Fig/many-C-comments}
\end{center}
The states are labeled mnemonically as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $s$ — We are between comments.
\item / — We just read the initial \Sym/ of a comment.
\item // — We are reading a line comment.
\item /* — We are reading a block comment, and we did not just read a \Sym* after the opening \Sym{/*}. 
\item /** — We are reading a block comment, and we just read a \Sym* after the opening \Sym{/*}. 
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\begin{rubric}
10 points = 5 for each part, using the standard DFA design rubric (scaled)
\end{rubric}


\vfil

\begin{rubric}[DFA design]
For problems worth 10 points:
\begin{itemize}
\item
2 points for an unambiguous description of a DFA, including the states set $Q$, the start state $s$, the accepting states $A$, and the transition function $\delta$.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\textbf{For drawings:} Use an arrow from nowhere to indicate $s$, and doubled circles to indicate accepting states $A$.  If $A=\varnothing$, say so explicitly.  If your drawing omits a reject state, say so explicitly.  \textbf{Draw neatly!}  If we can't read your solution, we can't give you credit for it,.

\item
\textbf{For text descriptions:} You can describe the transition function either using a 2d array, using mathematical notation, or using an algorithm.

\item
\textbf{For product constructions:} You must give a complete description of the states and transition functions of the DFAs you are combining (as either drawings or text), together with the accepting states of the product DFA.

\end{itemize}

\item
\textbf{Homework only:}
4 points for \emph{briefly} and correctly explaining the purpose of each state \emph{in English}.  This is how you justify that your DFA is correct.
\begin{itemize}
\item 
For product constructions, explaining the states in the factor DFAs is enough.
\item
\textcolor{Red}{\textbf{Deadly Sin:}} (“Declare your variables.”) No credit for the problem if the English description is missing, \emph{even if the DFA is correct}.
\end{itemize}


\item 
4 points for correctness.  (8 points on exams, with all penalties doubled)
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0pt
\item $-1$ for a single mistake: a single misdirected transition, a single missing or extra accept state, rejecting exactly one string that should be accepted, or accepting exactly one string that should be accepted. 
\item
$-2$ for incorrectly accepting/rejecting more than one but a finite number of strings.
\item
$-4$ for incorrectly accepting/rejecting an infinite number of strings.
\end{itemize}

\item 
DFA drawings with too many states may be penalized.  DFA drawings with \emph{significantly} too many states may get no credit at all.

\item 
Half credit for describing an NFA when the problem asks for a DFA.
\end{itemize}
\end{rubric}
