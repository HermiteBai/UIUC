\begin{enumerate}
	The McKing chain wants to open several restaurants along Red street
	in Shampoo-Banana. The possible locations are at $L_1,L_2, \ldots,
	L_n$ where $L_i$ is at distance $m_i$ meters from the start of Red
	street. Assume that the street is a straight line and the locations
	are in increasing order of distance from the starting point (thus $0
	\leq m_1 < m_2 < \ldots < m_n$). McKing has collected some data
	indicating that opening a restaurant at location $L_i$ will yield a
	profit of $p_i$ independent of where the other restaurants are
	located. However, the city of Shampoo-Banana has a zoning law which
	requires that any two McKing locations should be $D$ or more meters
	apart. Describe an algorithm that McKing can use to figure out the
	maximum profit it can obtain by opening restaurants while
	satisfying the city's zoning law.

\begin{solution}
	\mbox{}

Let $MaxP(i,j)$ be the maximum profit for  $0 \leq i \leq n$ and $0 \leq j \leq k$ by opening at most j restaurant in the location $1$ to $i$ such that the restaurants are at least D meters apart as required in the question.\\
Base Case: $MaxP(i,0) = 0$ for all i and $MaxP(0,j) = 0$ for all j. \\
Let $MaxIndex(i)$ be the largest index $a$ < $i$ such that $m_i - m_a \geq D$. We have the maximum profit $MaxP(i-1, j)$ if we do not open a restaurant at i. We also have the maximum profit $MaxP(MaxIndex(i), j-1) + p_i$ if we do open a restaurant at i and the nearest location to the left of $i$ is $Maxindex(i)$, and in this case, we can open at most $j-1$ restaurant from $1$ to $MaxIndex(i)$. $p_i$ is the profit for the restaurant at $i$ and $MaxP(MaxIndex(i), j-1)$ is the profit by opening at most $j-1$ restaurant in the location $MaxIndex(i)$ to $j-1$.\\
\\
Thus, we have
\begin{center}
	$MaxP(i,j)$ = max$\{$$MaxP(i-1, j)$, $MaxP(MaxIndex(i), j-1) + p_i$$\}$
\end{center}
We want to compute $MaxP(n, k)$. At first, $MaxIndex(i)$ takes $O(nlogn)$ time for sorting the $m_i$ values. And then the time to compute $MaxP(i,j)$ from previously computed values is $O(1)$. However, the number of subproblems is $O(nk)$.\\
\\
Thus, the algorithm takes \EMPH{$O(nk+nlogn)$} time and \EMPH{$O(nk)$} space.
\\
